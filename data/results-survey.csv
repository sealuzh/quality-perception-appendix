Additionally, you will also be given test metrics such as mutation and line coverage below the code snippets. To rate the test cases, you will see two matrices on the bottom of the page: One to rate the overall quality of the given unit test, and one for the rating according to the features you named before.     All the code snippets used in this survey are from the Java open source project apache/commons-lang.

Neither mutation coverage nor code coverage accurately represents whether a test suite is good. 

Integration tests tend to be more valuable than unit tests as they can better demonstrate: 1) what is a system supposed to be doing and 2) whether or not the system is still able to do that. 

The workflow around unit tests is super important. If engineers have to think about running tests, than they likely won't. Tooling should make tests disappear --- the tests should ""just work"" without requiring too much additional setup.

Having a CI/CD system that rejects commits which breaks tests is an important part of maintaining high quality tests.

Regardless of why or how we think we should be writing tests, those tests are only valuable if they help us to achieve our goals. If our beliefs and practices don't actually provide the benefits they seek, then we should aim to change our perceptions and change our habits.
